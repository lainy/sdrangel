<h2>Multi device support</h2>

Starting with version 2 SDRangel supports running several sampling devices simultaneously. Each concurrent device is associated to a slot with a set of tabbed windows in the UI. These tabs are marked R0, R1, R2... 

The slots are arranged in a stacked fashion so that when a new device is added with the Acquisition -> Add device set menu a new slot is allocated in the last position and when a device is removed with the Acquisition -> Remove last device set menu the slot in the last position is deleted. Slot 0 (R0) receiver slot is created at initialization and cannot be deleted with the menu. The letter "R" in the tab names indicates that the slot is for a receiver (source) device while "T" designates a transmitter (sink) device.

The tabbed windows are:

  - Sampling devices (1)
  - Sampling devices control (2)
  - Spectrum display control (3)
  - Channels (4)
  - Spectrum from device (5)

The combination of a sampling device and its associated channels is called a "device set".

![Main Window multi device support](../doc/img/MainWindow_tabs.png)

The sampling devices tab (1) acts as a master and when one of its tabs is selected all other tabs are selected accordingly i.e. all R0s, all R1s, etc... in tabs (2), (3), (4) and (5)

In each slave tab group (2), (3), (4) and (5) an individual tab corresponding to one device can be selected without affecting the selection of the other tabs. This way you can sneak peek into another spectrum or channel group without affecting the display of other tabbed windows.

<h5>OK button</h5>

Click here when done to dismiss the dialog.

<h3>2. Sampling devices</h3>

This is where the plugin GUI specific to the device is displayed. Control of one device is done from here. The common controls are:

![Sampling Device common](../doc/img/SampleDevice_common.png)

<h4>2.1. Start or stop acquisition</h4>

  - When a play icon (&#9654;) is displayed with a grey background the device is not operational
  - When a play icon (&#9654;) is displayed with a blue background the device is ready to start
  - When a stop icon (&#9632;) is displayed with a green background the device is currently running
  - When a play icon (&#9654;) is displayed with a red background there is an error and a popup displays the error message. An Error typically occurs when you try to start the same device in more than one tab.
  
<h4>2.2. Record I/Q</h4>

This is the I/Q from device record toggle. When a red background is displayed the recording is currently active. The name of the file created is `test_n.sdriq` where `n` is the slot number.

The format is S16LE I/Q samples. Thus there are 4 bytes per sample. I and Q values are 16 bit signed integers. The file starts with a context header containing information about center frequency, sample rate and timestamp of the start of the recording. This header has a length which is a multiple of a sample size (normally 24 bytes thus 6 samples). Thus this file can be used as a raw I/Q file with S16LE samples tolerating a glitch at the start corresponding to the 6 "random" samples. 

You can also zap the 24 bytes header with this Linux command: `tail -c +25 myfile.sdriq > myfile.raw`

To convert in another format you may use the sox utility. For example to convert to 32 bit (float) complex samples do:
`sox -r 48k −b 16 −e signed-integer -c 2 myfile.raw -e float -c 2 myfilec.raw`

Note that you have to specify the sampling rate and use `.raw` for the file extensions.

<h4>2.3. Device sampling rate</h4>

This is the sampling rate in kS/s of the I/Q stream extracted from the device after possible decimation. The main spectrum display corresponds to this sampling rate.

<h4>2.4. Center frequency</h4>

This is the current center frequency in kHz with dot separated thousands (MHz, GHz). On devices for which frequency can be directly controlled (i.e. all except File Source and SDRdaemon) you can use the thumbwheels to set the frequency. Thumbwheels move with the mouse wheel when hovering over a digit. 

When left clicking on a digit a cursor is set on it and you can also use the arrows to move the corresponding thumbwheel.

When right clicking on a digit the digits on the right are all set to zero. This effectively does a ceil rounding at the current position.

<h4>Additional inputs</h4>

Most devices will also present an interface to control automatic DC removal and I/Q imbalance and also a control of the LO correction in ppm.

  - Example1: ![Sampling Device corr 1](../doc/img/SampleDevice_corr01.png)
  - Example2: ![Sampling Device corr 2](../doc/img/SampleDevice_corr02.png)

<h3>3. Sampling devices control</h3>

This is where the sampling device for one device set is selected and the channel plugins are instantiated.

![Sampling Devices control](../doc/img/MainWindow_SDControl.png)

<h4>3.1. Currently sampling device name</h4>

This label shows the human readable sampling device name

<h4>3.2. Open sampling device change dialog</h4>

Use this push button to open the device selection dialog to change the sampling device. This dialog will open:

![Main Window sampling devices dialog](../doc/img/MainWindow_SDDialog.png)

<h5>3.2.1. Device selection combo</h5>

Use this combo box to select the device. Only available devices will appear in the list. For devices having more than one channel (ex: LimeSDR) the channel number will appear next to the device sequence number inside the brackets. Ex: `LimeSDR[0:1] 0009060B00473419` designates the second Rx (Rx #1) of the first encountered LimeSDR which serial number is 0009060B00473419.

<h5>3.2.2. Device selection confirmation</h5>

Use the `OK` button to confirm your choice and exit the dialog

<h5>3.2.3. Device selection cancellation</h5>

Use the `Cancel` button to exit the dialog without any change

<h4>3.3. Reload currently selected device</h4>

This button activates a close/open sequence to recycle the device. It may be useful when the device is not streaming anymore or in an attempt to clear possible errors. Make sure the streaming is stopped first.

<h4>3.4. Channel selector</h4>

Use this combo box to select a channel plugin to create a new channel

<h4>3.5. Add a new channel</h4>

Use this push button to add a new channel with the selected plugin

<h3>4. Spectrum display control</h3>

![Spectrum GUI](../doc/img/MainWindow_spectrum_gui.png)

These are the controls of the main spectrum display in (7). The same controls are found in the plugins that feature a spectrum display:
  - Channel Analyzer
  - Broadcast FM demodulator
  - SSB demodulator
  - UDP source
  - UDP sink

<h4>4.1. FFT window selector</h4>

Use this combo box to select which window is applied to the FFT:
  - **Bart**: Bartlett
  - **B-H**: Blackmann-Harris
  - **FT**: Flat top
  - **Ham**: Hamming (default)
  - **Han**: Hanning
  - **Rec**: Rectangular (no window)
  
<h4>4.2. FFT size</h4>

Select the size of the FFT window among these values:
  - 128
  - 256
  - 512
  - 1k = 1024 (default)
  - 2k = 2048
  - 4k = 4096

<h4>4.3. Reference level</h4>

This is the level in dB at the top of the display range. You can select values between 0 and -110 in 5 dB steps

<h4>4.4. Range</h4>

This is the range of display in dB. You can select values between 5 and 100 in 5 dB steps

<h4>4.5. Averaging mode</h4>

Use this combo to select which averaging mode is applied:
  - **No**: no averaging. Disables averaging regardless of the number of averaged samples (4.6). This is the default option
  - **Mov**: moving average. This is a sliding average over the amount of samples specified next (4.6). There is one complete FFT line produced at every FFT sampling period
  - **Fix**: fixed average. Average is done over the amount of samples specified next (4.6) and a result is produced at the end of the corresponding period then the next block of averaged samples is processed. There is one complete FFT line produced every FFT sampling period multiplied by the number of averaged samples (4.6). The time scale on the waterfall display is updated accordingly.

<h4>4.6. Number of averaged samples</h4>
  
Each FFT bin (squared magnitude) is averaged over a number of samples. This combo allows selecting the number of samples between these values: 0 (no averaging), 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1k (1000). The tooltip mentions the resulting averaging period considering the baseband sample rate and FFT size.
Averaging reduces the noise variance and can be used to better detect weak continuous signals. The fixed averaging mode allows long time monitoring on the waterfall.

<h4>4.7. Phosphor display stroke decay</h4>

This controls the decay rate of the stroke when phosphor display is engaged (4.C)

<h4>4.8. Phosphor display holdoff</h4>

This controls the holdoff when phosphor display is engaged (4.C)

<h4>4.9. Phosphor display stroke strength</h4>

This controls the stroke strength when phosphor display is engaged (4.C)

<h4>4.A. Trace intensity</h4>

This controls the intensity of the maximum (4.D) and current (4.E) spectrum trace

<h4>4.B. Clear spectrum</h4>

This resets the maximum spectrum trace and phosphor remanence

<h4>4.C. Phosphor display</h4>

Toggles the phosphor display on the spectrum

<h4>4.D. Maximum trace</h4>

Toggles the maximum trace display (red trace) on the spectrum

<h4>4.E. Current trace</h4>

Toggles the current trace display (yellow trace) on the spectrum

<h4>4.F. Waterfall/spectrum placement</h4>

Toggles the spectrum on top or on bottom versus waterfall

<h4>4.G. Waterfall</h4>

Toggles the waterfall display

<h4>4.H.Grid</h4>

Toggles the grid display

<h4>4.I.Grid intensity</h4>

Controls the intensity of the grid display

<h4>4.J. Logarithmic/linear scale</h4>

Use this toggle button to switch between spectrum logarithmic and linear scale display. The face of the button will change to represent either a logaritmic or linear curve.

When in linear mode the range control (4.4) has no effect because the actual range is between 0 and the reference level. The reference level in dB (4.3) still applies but is translated to a linear value e.g -40 dB is 1e-4. In linear mode the scale numbers are formatted using scientific notation so that they always occupy the same space.

<h3>5. Presets and commands</h3>

The presets and commands tree view are by default stacked in tabs. The following sections describe the presets section 5A) and commands (section 5B) views successively 

<h3>5A. Presets</h3>

This is a tree view of the saved presets. Presets record the channels setup and a copy of the settings of each sample source that has been used when saving this preset. Thus you can use the same channel arrangement with various devices having their particular setup.

![Main Window presets view](../doc/img/MainWindow_presets_view.png)

<h4>5A.1. Preset selection</h4>

You select a preset or a preset group by clicking on its line in the tree view. All actions (6) will be done relative to this preset or preset group.

<h4>5A.2. Group</h4>

You can organize your presets into groups. Groups can be collapsed or expanded by using the caret icon on the left.

<h4>5A.3. Center frequency</h4>

The center frequency used in this preset is displayed here.

<h4>5A.4. Rx/Tx indicator</h4>

"R" is displayed for a Rx device set and "T" for a Tx device set

<h4>5A.5. Preset name</h4>

You can give a name to your preset. Names need not to be unique.

<h4>5A.6. Preset control or actions</h4>

The controls are located as icons at the bottom of the window: 

![Main Window presets](../doc/img/MainWindow_presets.png)

Click on this icon to create a new preset with the current values in the selected sample device tab (Main window: 2).

<h5>5A.6.2. Update preset</h5>

Click on this icon to create a update the selected preset with the current values in the selected sample device tab (Main window: 2). Please note that this does not save the preset immediately on disk to save presets immediately you need to use the save button (4).

<h5>5A.6.3. Edit preset</h5>

Opens a new window where you can change the group name and description. 

  - for group items you can rename the group or merge all group presets into an existing group by selecting this existing group
  - for preset items you can:
    - move the preset to another existing group by selecting this existing group
    - assign this preset to a new group by typing in this new group
    - change the description

<h5>5A.6.4. Save presets</h5>

Presets are saved to disk automatically at exit time you can however request to save them immediately using this icon.

<h5>5A.6.5. Export preset</h5>

Using the previous icon presets are saved globally in a system dependent place. Using this icon you can export a specific preset in a single file that can be imported on another machine possibly with a different O/S. The preset binary data (BLOB) is saved in Base-64 format.

<h5>5A.6.6. Import preset</h5>

This is the opposite of the previous operation. This will create a new preset in the selected group or the same group as the preset being selected.

<h5>5A.6.7. Delete preset</h5>

  - on a preset item: deletes the selected preset. 
  - on a preset group: deletes the group and all its presets.

<h5>5A.6.8. Load preset</h5>

Applies the selected preset to the current device set (source and channel plugins).  

<h3>5B. Commands</h3>

This is a tree view of the saved commands. Commands describe the path to an executable file, its arguments a possible link to a keystroke event that triggers the execution. Similarly to presets commands can be arranged into groups and have a description short text.

Typically an "executable file" is a script (Python, shell, whatever...) or can be a compiled program (c, c++, java, whatever...) that interacts with SDRangel using its web REST API. When called from within SDRangel they can act as "macros" allowing to perform actions automatically.

Of course any binary that resides in your system can be used that way like `/bin/ls` or `/bin/date` although these two are of anecdotal interest...

![Main Window presets view](../doc/img/MainWindow_commands_view.png)

<h5>5B.6.5. View last command run details</h5>

This dialog will show the results of the last run including the output (merged stdout and stderr).

![Main Window command output](../doc/img/MainWindow_command_output.png)

<h6>5B.6.5.1. Process status</h6>

When the process is not running the stop icon (&#9632;) is displayed. The background color indicate different states:

  - no color (same as background): the process has never run during this session
  - red: the process ended with error
  - green: the process ended successfully. This does not mean that there was no programmatic error.
  
When the process is running the play icon (&#9654;) is displayed with an orange background.

<h6>5B.6.5.2. Refresh data</h6>

Pushing this button will update the data displayed with the latest status. Please note that the log is displayed only when the process is terminated.

<h6>5B.6.5.3. Start time</h6>

This is the timestamp of process start. It is filled with dots `...` if the process has never started during this session.

<h6>5B.6.5.4. End time</h6>

<h6>5B.6.5.7. Command line</h6>

This shows the actual command line that was used to start the process

<h6>5B.6.5.8. Error status</h6>

This is the translation of `QProcess::ProcessError`. Possible values are:

  - `...`: the process has never run during this session
  - `Failed to start`: the process could not start. For example the executable file has no execution rights actually
  - `Crashed`: the process ended with crash. This is the status when you killed the process
  - `Timed out`: the last waitFor...() function timed out.
  - `Write error`: an error occurred when attempting to write to the process. For example, the process may not be running, or it may have closed its input channel.
  - `Read error`: an error occurred when attempting to read from the process. For example, the process may not be running.
  - `Unknown error`: an unknown error occurred.
  
<h6>5B.6.5.9. Exit code</h6>

This is the program exit code. When the process crashes this is the signal by which the process end was caused. For example if you kill the process with button (6) it sends the process a SIGKILL (code 9) and therefore the value is 9.

<h6>5B.6.5.10. Exit status</h6>

There are only two possibilities: either the program exits normally but possibly with a non zero exit code or it ends with a crash.

<h6>5B.6.5.11. Process log</h6>

<h5>5B.6.7. Delete commands or group of commands</h5>

This will delete the currently selected command or if selection is a group this will delete all commands in the group.

<h5>5B.6.8. Activate keyboard binding</h5>

Use this button to activate the keyboard binding. This requires that the focus is set to the main window. On a few occasions the main window looses focus and the button gets unselected. Just click again on this button to reactivate the keyboard binding. Note that you need to have this button selected (its background should be lit in beige/orange) for the key binding to be effective.

<h3>6. Channels</h3>

This area shows the control GUIs of the channels currently active for the device. When the preset is saved (as default at exit time or as a saved preset) the GUIs are ordered by increasing frequency. If presets share the same frequency they are ordered by their internal ID name. Thus new channel GUIs will appear ordered only when reloaded.

Details about the GUIs can be found in the channel plugins documentation which consists of a readme.md file in each of the channel plugins folder (done partially).

With these channels: AM demod, BFM demod, DSD demod, NFM demod, UDP source, UDP sink some common basic settings can be set with a popup dialog. This dialog is opened by clicking on the small grey square on the top left of the channel window. The settings are as follows:

![Basic channel settings](../doc/img/BasicChannelSettings.png)

<h4>6.1: Window title</h4>

Changes the channel window title

<h4>6.2: Channel color</h4>

Changes the color of the window title bar and spectrum overlay. To change the color click on the color square to open a color chooser dialog. The hex rgb value is displayed next to the color square.

<h4>6.3: Frequency scale display type</h4>

When the mouse is over the channel window or over the central line in the spectrum a channel parameter is displayed on the frequency scale. This parameter can be:

  - Freq: channel absolute center frequency
  - Title: channel window title
  - AdSnd: UDP address and send port
  - AdRcv: UDP address and receive port
  
<h4>6.4: Validate and exit dialog</h4>

Validates the data (saves it in the channel marker object) and exits the dialog

<h4>6.5: Cancel changes and exit dialog</h4>

Do not make any changes and exit dialog

<h3>7. Spectrum from device</h3>

This shows the spectrum in the passband returned from the sampling device possibly after decimation. The actual sample rate is shown in the device control at the left of the frequency display (2.3)

The spectrum display is controlled by the display control (4).
